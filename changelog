I am tired of getters and setters in cpp,
so i deceided since now make every field in
every class public. I was thinking how should
i do, take the input file and parse the whole
file into tokens, or try to combine tokenizer
and parser. I deceided to separate them, and
parse the whole file. Yes, that will cost a
more memory than it could, but if i combine
them, it will cause complexity problems and
i will strrugle to scan and parse source code
at the same time. So i make it simple.
