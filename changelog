I am tired of getters and setters in cpp,
so i deceided since now make every field in
every class public. I was thinking how should
i do, take the input file and parse the whole
file into tokens, or try to combine tokenizer
and parser. I deceided to separate them, and
parse the whole file. Yes, that will cost a
more memory than it could, but if i combine
them, it will cause complexity problems and
i will strrugle to scan and parse source code
at the same time. So i make it simple.

I started making vector, but didint finish.
Now compiler can compile only arithmetic
expression, and i realized that C is not that
different from assembly as i thought. I gonna
make in Lexer, vector<char> field, and i gonna
store there current lexeme, and when i parsed it
i will compare it with keywords, if nothing is
matched, this is identifier. I guess it is bad
for perfomance, but i just wanna try write like
this. I tried write it with pointers and buffers.
Maybe then i will rewrite it.
